### What is the problem we are trying to solve?
- We are building a **healthcare platform** to get an idea about _a person’s illness based on the symptoms using some machine learning algorithms_ and then connect them with a specialized doctor to get a quick **consultation** regarding it via `in-app chat and video calls`.
- Following this, the patient will receive a medicinal prescription based on his assessment in a pdf format.
- This prescription can be used to order their medicines online via the medicine stores already in contact with the application.
